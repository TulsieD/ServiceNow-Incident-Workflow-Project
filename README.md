# ServiceNow SecOps Demo Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **ServiceNow Security Operations (SecOps) demo implementation** designed to showcase incident management, vulnerability response, and security reporting workflows.  
It simulates how a security team can use ServiceNow to automate incident handling, manage vulnerabilities, and visualize key security metrics—without requiring enterprise integrations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Demonstrate **Security Incident Response (SIR)** workflows
- Simulate **Vulnerability Response (VR)** using mock data
- Create **dashboards** for incident and vulnerability metrics
- Showcase automation and best practices in a simplified environment

## 🔐 1. [Security Incident Response (SIR)](./Security%20Incident%20Response/README.md)
### Objective
Simulate incident ingestion and automated workflows for handling security alerts.

### Steps Implemented
1. **Mock SIEM Ingestion**
   - Created sample incidents (Phishing, Malware, Brute-force alerts).
   - Added custom fields (Alert Source, IP Address, Severity).
   
2. **Business Rules**
   - Automated assignment based on category (Phishing → Tier 1 Analyst).
   - Automated prioritization based on severity.

3. **Incident Workflow**
   - Designed a workflow in Flow Designer:
     - New → In Progress → Resolved
     - Notifications triggered at each stage.

### Deliverables
- Key Value: Automated triage reduces manual effort and accelerates response.

---

## 🛡 2. [Vulnerability Response (VR)](./Vulnerability%20Response/README.md)
### Objective
Simulate vulnerability imports and automated remediation task assignment.

### Steps Implemented
1. **Mock Vulnerability Import**
   - Imported [CSV](./Vulnerability%20Response/data/mock_vulnerabilities.csv`) with vulnerabilities (CVSS, Asset, Description).

2. **Asset Linking**
   - Created Configuration Items (CIs) in CMDB.
   - Linked vulnerabilities to assets for contextual risk analysis.

3. **Remediation Workflow**
   - Workflow auto-generates remediation tasks for High/Critical vulnerabilities.
   - Tasks assigned to IT Operations group.

### Deliverables
- Key Value: Provides clear vulnerability ownership and SLA-driven remediation.

---

## 📊 3. Dashboards & Reporting
### Objective
Visualize security data for actionable insights.

### Dashboards Created
- **Incident Dashboard**
  - Open incidents by severity
  - MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution)
  - Status breakdown (pie chart)

- **Vulnerability Dashboard**
  - Vulnerabilities by CVSS score
  - Remediation progress (open vs. closed tasks)

### Deliverables
- Key Value: Enables data-driven decision-making for security teams.

## 🏆 Business Value
This demo shows how organizations can:
- Automate incident triage and assignment.
- Integrate vulnerability management into security workflows.
- Use dashboards to measure security posture.
- Reduce response time and improve security visibility.

---

## 📝 Future Enhancements
- Simulate API-based SIEM integration
- Add Threat Intelligence enrichment
- Automate compliance checks with mock data
